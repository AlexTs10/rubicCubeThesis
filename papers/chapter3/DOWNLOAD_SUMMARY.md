## Alternative Papers for Missing Content

While we couldn't download the original Culberson 1997 paper, the **Hearn & Demaine 2005 "PSPACE-Completeness of Sliding-Block Puzzles"** paper covers Sokoban's PSPACE-completeness and provides similar (and in some ways, stronger) results using a different proof technique.

For the Ratner & Warmuth paper, you may need to:
1. Access through a university library with Elsevier/ScienceDirect subscription
2. Request via interlibrary loan
3. Contact the authors directly
4. Use a related arXiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03146 "A simple proof that the (n^2-1)-puzzle is hard"
