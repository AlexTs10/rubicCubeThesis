NOTES:
======
- The Edelkamp symbolic pattern databases paper from 2002 is available on
  Semantic Scholar and ResearchGate but requires account or request form
- The Hayakawa 2015 paper is from PASCO (not IEEE SMC as originally stated)
- Successfully obtained quantum optimization paper and one of the planning papers
- Related work on GPU-accelerated puzzle solving has been downloaded

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
- To get Hayakawa paper: Contact authors via ResearchGate or check ACM Digital Library
- To get Edelkamp 2002 paper: Try Semantic Scholar or ResearchGate PDF request
