   CRITICAL FINDING: Confirms Kociemba's 1992 publication details:
   "In 1992, another improvement upon Thistlethwaite's algorithm was published 
   in Cubism For Fun. Herbert Kociemba combined steps of Thistlethwaite's 
   algorithm to reduce it to a two stage process. It was stated that all tested 
   positions were solved in a maximum of 21 moves."

KOCIEMBA'S TWO-PHASE ALGORITHM (THE KEY HISTORICAL CONTRIBUTION)
================================================================================

Publication Details:
- Title: "Close to God's algorithm"
- Author: Herbert Kociemba
- Publication: Cubism For Fun, Vol. 28, 1992, pp. 10-13
- Maximum Moves: 21 (later verified as 20)
- Original Constraint: Four phases reduced to two phases

Algorithm Structure:
Phase 1: Orient edges, move U/D pieces to U/D layers, orient corners
         Group definition: <U, D, L2, R2, F2, B2>
         
Phase 2: Complete solution within Phase 1 constraints
         Uses only allowed moves from Phase 1
         
Total Average: 20 moves or fewer on random positions

Historical Significance:
- Reduced Thistlethwaite's algorithm from 4 phases to 2
- Became foundation for modern cube-solving software
- Kociemba Explorer software still widely used today
- Theoretical contribution to prove optimal bounds

TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

HTTP/HTTPS Issues:
- Jaap's Puzzle Site (jaapsch.net) redirects HTTP to HTTPS but has SSL handshake failures
- Likely certificate issues on that server
- Workaround: Check archive.org for historical snapshots

Successful Methods:
- Direct curl requests to HTTPS URLs with proper certificate handling
- Python urllib for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Standard web fetching for static content
- HTML archives of dynamic sites captured successfully

Move Metric Used:
- All resources use HTM (Half-Turn Metric)
- 1 move = one 90-degree or 180-degree turn
- God's Number = 20 in HTM

Group Theory Foundations:
- All algorithms use coset analysis and subgroup reductions
- Progressive constraint of solution space through multiple phases
- Move and pruning tables for heuristic guidance
- IDA* search algorithm with lower-bound heuristics

RESEARCH FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. Kociemba's "Close to God's Algorithm" (1992) was confirmed as the key
   historical contribution bridging Thistlethwaite's 4-phase algorithm
   (52 moves) to the modern 2-phase algorithm (20 moves).

2. The progression of improvements shows continuous refinement:
   1980: 52 moves → 1992: 21 moves → 2010: 20 moves (proven optimal)

3. Herbert Kociemba's contributions are foundational:
   - 1992: Two-phase algorithm ("Close to God's algorithm")
   - 2010: Collaborated on definitive proof of God's Number = 20
   - Cube Explorer software still widely used in 2024

4. Group theory and symmetry reductions were essential to reducing the
   computational search space from 43 quintillion positions to manageable
   portions that could be computed.
