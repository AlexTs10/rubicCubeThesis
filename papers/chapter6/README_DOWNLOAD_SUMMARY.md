### 1. ✅ McGeoch "Experimental analysis of algorithms" (2001)
- **File**: `McGeoch_2001_Experimental_Analysis_of_Algorithms.pdf` (648 KB)
- **Source**: University of Auckland (https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~mcw/Teaching/refs/misc/mcgeoch_2001_experimental_analysis_of_algorithms.pdf)
- **Notes**: This is a comprehensive paper on experimental analysis of algorithms. While the original request was for a 2002 Handbook chapter, this 2001 paper covers similar material and is from the same time period. McGeoch's work in the Handbook of Data Structures and Applications (2005, not 2002) is based on similar content.
